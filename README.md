# Introduction

Among various life-threatening diseases, heart disease has garnered a great deal of attention in medical research. The diagnosis of heart disease is a challenging task, which can offer an automated prediction about the heart condition of the patient so that further treatment can be made effective. The diagnosis of heart disease is usually based on signs, symptoms, and physical examination of the patient. There are several factors that increase the risk of heart diseases, such as smoking habits, body cholesterol level, family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical exercise.

This project was implemented and executed by applying the KNN algorithm with a recognition accuracy of around 85.06%. The desired results have been obtained by training the machine learning model first using 67% of the heart_disease_train data-set and later testing the model by remaining 33% of dataset and the results are obtained successfully. Concludes, that around 85.06% of patients with the symptoms as according to the dataset would suffer from heart diseases.
