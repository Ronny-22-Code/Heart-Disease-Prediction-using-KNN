# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This repository demonstrates the project of "Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning". This project has been created by implementing the K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. Initially, the Machine Learning model of KNN Algorithm is trained using heart_disease_train dataset and late on the expected results are tested and obtained successfully. The accuracy of around 85.3 % was achieved after the successful execution of the Machine Learning Model.
